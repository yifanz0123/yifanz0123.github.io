      I am a Ph.D. candidate at Toulouse School of Economics and I will be in the 2024/25 academic job market. I apply empirical tools to understand to determinants of individual beliefs and behaviors.  
My research fields are Economic History, Development Economics, and Political Economy. In my JMP, I identify and compare both horizontal transmission and vertical transmission of son preference with the usage of natural experiments, historical archives, and population censuses.
