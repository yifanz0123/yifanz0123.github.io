        I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Toulouse School of Economics. I apply empirical tools to understand the determinants of individual beliefs and behaviors. I will join the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University as a Postdoc in 2025-26 AY.

        My research fields are Economic History, Development Economics, and Political Economy. In my ongoing work, I identify and compare both horizontal transmission and vertical transmission of son preference with the usage of natural experiments, historical archives, and population censuses.
