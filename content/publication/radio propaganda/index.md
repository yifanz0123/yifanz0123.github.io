## Abstract
  
Drawing on individual-level data from the 2000-15 population censuses and 2010-20 social surveys, I analyze the concequences of radio propaganda from Taiwan on mainland China. My prelimnary results suggest that individuals who lived in the areas with better exposure to the Voice of Free China during adolescence, are less likely to join bureacratic system and Chinese Communist Party. Besides, they have lower trust to local government but are more like to start their own business.
